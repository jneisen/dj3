This right here is duck jump the game the third (work title). It is a game that I am coding singlehandedly from scratch using mingw64 and opengl and my ide is VIM. I have had help from friends on sprite stuff and story (and in the future hopefully music). It uses an 8 bit style because it looks awesome (coding limitations aka I don't want to type in more than 64 numbers per sprite to spriteData.txt).
